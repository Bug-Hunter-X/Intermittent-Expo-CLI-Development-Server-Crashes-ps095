The solution involved several steps to narrow down the cause.  While the original intermittent crashes couldn't be directly reproduced due to their random nature, we found that a combination of actions improved stability.  First, we upgraded all Expo and React Native dependencies to their latest versions.  `expo upgrade` was run to ensure compatibility. Second, careful monitoring of the terminal during development helped catch a previously unnoticed warning in the background, related to a memory leak in a third-party library. Removing that library (or replacing it with a more efficient alternative if necessary) eliminated the warnings and greatly reduced the frequency of crashes.  Finally, restarting the development server after making significant code changes helped ensure a clean state.  We added a script to automate the `expo start --clear` command.
