While using Expo CLI, I encountered an issue where the development server would intermittently crash without providing any meaningful error messages in the console.  This would happen randomly, making debugging difficult. The app would build and run initially but crash after some time. I've checked my code for obvious syntax errors and the expo config file for potential misconfigurations. Nothing seemed out of place.
